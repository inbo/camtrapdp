\section{Assign taxonomic information}{


Camtrap DP metadata has a \code{taxonomic} property that can contain extra
information for each \code{scientificName} found in observations.
Such information can include higher taxonomy (\code{family}, \code{order}, etc.) and
vernacular names in multiple languages.

This function \strong{will automatically include this taxonomic information in
observations}, as extra columns starting with \code{taxon.}.
It will then update the \code{taxonomic} scope in the metadata to the unique
\code{\link[=taxa]{taxa()}} found in the data.
}

\section{Assign eventIDs}{


Observations can contain two classifications at two levels:

\strong{Media-based} observations (\code{observationLevel = "media"}) are based on a
single media file and are directly linked to it via \code{mediaID}.

\strong{Event-based} observations (\code{observationLevel = "event"}) are based on an
event, defined as a combination of \code{eventID}, \code{eventStart} and \code{eventEnd}.
This event can consist of one or more media files, but is not directly linked
to these.

This function \strong{will automatically assign \code{eventID}s to media}, using
\code{media.deploymentID = event.deploymentID} and \verb{eventStart <= media.timestamp <= eventEnd}.
Note that this can result in media being linked to multiple events (and thus
being duplicated), for example when events and sub-events were defined.
}

\section{Update metadata}{


Camtrap DP metadata has a \code{spatial} and \code{temporal} property that contains the
spatial and temporal coverage of the package respectively.

This function \strong{will automatically update the spatial and temporal scopes}
in the metadata based on the data.
It also does this for the taxonomic scope (see higher).
