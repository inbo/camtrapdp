Extracts the version number used by a Camera Trap Data Package object.
This version number indicates what version of the \href{https://camtrap-dp.tdwg.org}{Camtrap DP standard} was used.
}
\details{
The version number is derived as follows:
\enumerate{
\item The \code{version} attribute, if defined.
\item A version number contained in \code{x$profile}, which is expected to
contain the URL to the used Camtrap DP standard.
\item \code{x$profile} in its entirety (can be \code{NULL}).
