## Resubmission

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Updated write_dwc() so it no longer writes to the user's home filespace by default. The directory needs to be explicitly provided by the user. Tests write to tempdir().

## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
